# Unlocking Amazon Sales Trends with Tableau

#Introduction

This project analyzes Amazon's sales data from 2012 to 2015. Known for its innovation and dominance in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming, Amazon is one of the world's top technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. By 2023, it was the largest online retailer and marketplace, a leader in cloud services through AWS, and a top player in smart speakers and live streaming via Twitch.

Amazon ranked as the second-largest private employer in the U.S. and the second-largest company globally by revenue in 2024. With 82% of its website traffic coming from the U.S. and a record $73 billion in R&D spending in 2022, the company’s focus on innovation remains unmatched. This report aims to uncover key insights from its sales data during this period.

# Conclusion


This report reveals that Amazon's operating margin was relatively low, with a profit percentage of just 11%. Losses in multiple regions emphasize the need for a stronger focus on customer behavior, service improvements, and feedback management to remain competitive and seize opportunities.

The dashboard provides a clear view of Amazon's performance across categories, regions, and countries, making it easier to pinpoint areas of success and regions requiring attention. It serves as a useful tool for understanding challenges and guiding strategic decisions.
